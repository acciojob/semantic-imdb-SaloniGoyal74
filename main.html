		<p>Krish Kapoor is an aspiring but volatile musician trying to find his place, haunted by childhood trauma and driven by a mix of passion and anger. Vaani Batra is a poetess and writer, emotionally wounded after being jilted by her fiancé on their wedding day.
		</p>
		<p>The two meet when Vaani is hired to write lyrics for one of Krish’s musical projects. Their creative collaboration soon leads to a deep emotional bond. As love blossoms, they face personal insecurities, misunderstandings, and the pressures of ambition. Their relationship is tested at every turn—by Krish’s unstable nature, Vaani’s past, and the challenge of trying to grow together.

		<p>“Vaani Batra: सैयारा मतलब तारों में इक तन्हा तारा, खुद जलकर जो रोशन कर दे जग ये सारा।”</p>
		<p>I like this because it captures both the poetic beauty of the film and the sense of sacrifice and admiration in love — someone willing to shine, burning away quietly, just to light up everything else.</p>
